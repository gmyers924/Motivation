            much better about themself. A person could help another by showing them <i>videos</i> on the internet or by showing <i>motivating music</i> to listen to that could help
            <em>inspire</em> them. Tell them a <b>motivating</b> story to <em>inspire</em> them to get up and keep trying.

        <h2>Responding to Others</h2>


        <p class="pop-out">
            Some of the ways a person can <b>motivate</b> someone is to tell a <b>motivational</b> comment like <q>you are doing great.</q> A person could also say, <q>
                wow that is cool,
                how do you do that.
            </q> A person could also try to be an <em>idol</em> to them and help them every step of the way by asking <i>what</i>, <i>when</i>, and <i>why</i> they need the
            thing they want. Try to believe that they could <em>achieve</em> the goal because they would be more <em></em> and <em>willing</em> to attempt to try to <em>achieve</em> the goal.
